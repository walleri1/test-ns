This project is created to demonstrate how to create a Next.js ecommerce using Snipcart and DatoCMS.

Read the full tutorial on [DatoCMS blog](https://www.datocms.com/blog/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-nextjs-snipcart-tutorial)

## Register on Snipcart

To see the fully working example you need to register on Snipcart and provide your NEXT_PUBLIC_SNIPCART_API_KEY in your `.env.local` file

## Install from Github

[![Clone DatoCMS project](https://dashboard.datocms.com/clone/button.svg)](https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdatocms%2Fecommerce-demo-react-snipcart)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
